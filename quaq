    Added in code to assign timeslots upon confirmation
    
    * Timeslot is assigned upon confirmation of the account through
      email.
    * If the account is from any country besides China, a timeslot will
      be assigned based on a first come, first serve basis.
    * Timeslot will be stored in the database using a millisecond format.
      Any part of the application that needs to display a nicely formatted
      time has to parse this millisecond format. This is made easy using
      the joda-time library.

    Local Storage // History Tokens // Bug fix

commit 44c1c74ee17106d57479af442a367e337fd4e939

    Fixed a bug that occurs when email is changed twice in a single session.
    
    The bug was caused due to Shiro using the email address as the primary
    pricipal of the authenticated session. This causes issues if the email
    address is changed as Shiro offers no avenue for updating the pricipal.
    
    The bug is fixed by changing the authentication process to use the
    never-changing contestant_id primary key of the Student class.

    Introduces the use of local storage into the application
    
    This commit is an attempt to reduce the number of RPC calls to the
    server. By caching the user's profile data locally using the storage
    space introduced with HTML 5, the number of RPC calls to retrieve
    the profile data is reduced.
    
    The code has been introduced in two screens, the ContestDetailsScreen
    as well as the ProfileScreen.
